Description: When a model is loaded more than once, not all of the geometry shows on the second load. This can be seen with the USM detail model.
Reproduce: model usm_detail.obj, then model usm_detail.obj, then repeat until problem occurs

Probable causes: memory leak in model, memory leak in parse.cpp

BUG : OBJ loader does not open generic OBJ files
Reporter: M Bennett
Date: 5/5/08

Description: the OBJ loader has been hand-written to handle files from sketchup exporter ONLY. It might need to be more robust in the future.

Probable soln: rewrite parts of parse.cpp to handle generic obj files: loadpolylistobj(), loadregionlistobj()

=======================

BUG : explosion placement in tiny regions
Reporter: M Bennett
Date: 5/5/08

Description: explosions can be created in regions too small for them, causing a program crash

reproduction: create a region 1 ft x 1 ft and 'explode <region #> 1'.

probable soln: change explosion.cpp or make an explosion factory method

BUG : cam files hard to find
Reporter: M Bennett
Date: 5/5/08
