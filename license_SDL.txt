Licensing the Simple DirectMedia Layer library

    The Simple DirectMedia Layer library is currently available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or newer.

    SDL's use of the LGPL is twofold:

        * Allow end users to use custom versions of the library, to support bug fixes and other enhancements.
        * Allow any improvements made to the library for one project to benefit the community as a whole. 

    To comply with this license, you must give prominent notice that you use the Simple DirectMedia Layer library, and that it is included under the terms of the LGPL license. You must provide a copy of the LGPL license.
    You must also do one of the following:

       1. Link with the library as a shared object (e.g. SDL.dll or libSDL.so)
       2. Provide the object or source code to your application along with any libraries and custom tools not available with a standard platform development kit. You may also simply provide a written offer, valid for three years, to provide these materials upon request to anyone with a legal copy of your application. 

    If you include the SDL library in binary form, you should also make available the source code to the version you provide, including any customizations you have made. If you link to a standard version of the library, simply referring to the SDL website is sufficient.
